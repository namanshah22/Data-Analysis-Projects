# NYC SAT Performance Analysis

This project analyzes SAT performance data for New York City public schools. The data is contained in the `schools.csv` file.

## Questions

The project answers three key questions:

1. Which schools produce the highest math scores?
2. Who are the top 10 schools based on average results across reading, math, and writing?
3. Which NYC borough has the largest standard deviation for SAT results?

## Results

The results of the analysis are as follows:

* The school with the highest average math SAT score is Stuyvesant High School, with a score of 820.
* The top 10 schools based on average SAT scores are:
    * Stuyvesant High School
    * Bronx High School of Science
    * Brooklyn Technical High School
    * High School of American Studies at Lehman College
    * Queens High School for the Sciences at York College
    * Brooklyn Latin School
    * Hunter College High School
    * Beacon High School
    * Eleanor Roosevelt High School
* The borough with the largest standard deviation for SAT results is Brooklyn, with a standard deviation of 99.

## Conclusion

The results of this analysis suggest that there is a great deal of variation in SAT performance among NYC public schools. Some schools, such as Stuyvesant High School, consistently produce high SAT scores, while other schools have much lower average scores. The results also suggest that there is a significant difference in SAT performance between different boroughs. Brooklyn has the largest standard deviation for SAT results, suggesting that there is a wider range of performance in this borough than in other boroughs.

## Limitations

This analysis is based on a limited dataset of SAT scores for NYC public schools. It is possible that the results would be different if the dataset included SAT scores for all NYC public schools. Additionally, the analysis does not take into account other factors that may affect SAT performance, such as socioeconomic status and school resources.

## Next Steps

The next steps for this analysis could include:

* Expanding the dataset to include SAT scores for all NYC public schools.
* Including other factors that may affect SAT performance, such as socioeconomic status and school resources.
* Conducting a more in-depth analysis of the factors that contribute to high SAT performance.
