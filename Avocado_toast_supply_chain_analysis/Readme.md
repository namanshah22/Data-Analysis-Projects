# Avocado Toast Supply Chain Analysis

This project analyzes the supply chain of the ingredients used to make avocado toast. The ingredients are avocado, lemon, salt flakes, sourdough bread, and extra virgin olive oil. The data used for this project is from the [Open Food Facts database](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/).

## Data

The data is contained in `.csv` files in the `data/` folder provided. The `avocado.csv` file contains information about avocados, the `lemon.csv` file contains information about lemons, the `sourdough.csv` file contains information about sourdough bread, the `salt_flakes.csv` file contains information about salt flakes, and the `olive_oil.csv` file contains information about extra virgin olive oil.

## Analysis

The analysis of the data focuses on the following topics:

* **Origin:** The origin of each ingredient is determined.
* **Transportation:** The transportation method used to transport each ingredient is determined.
* **Time to market:** The time it takes for each ingredient to reach the market is determined.

## Results

The results of the analysis show that the ingredients used to make avocado toast have a complex supply chain. The avocado originates in Peru, the lemon originates in South Africa, the sourdough bread originates in the United Kingdom, the salt flakes originate in the United Kingdom, and the extra virgin olive oil originates in Italy. The transportation methods used to transport these ingredients vary, but they all involve a significant amount of time and distance.

## Recommendations

Based on the results of the analysis, the following recommendations can be made to improve the sustainability of the avocado toast supply chain:

* **Choose local ingredients:** When possible, choose ingredients that are grown or produced locally. This will reduce the environmental impact of the supply chain.
* **Support sustainable farming practices:** When choosing ingredients, support farmers who are using sustainable farming practices. This will help to protect the environment and ensure that the ingredients are of high quality.
* **Reduce food waste:** Avoid wasting food by only buying the amount of food that you need. This will also help to reduce the environmental impact of the supply chain.

## Conclusion

The results of this analysis suggest that there are a number of ways to improve the sustainability of the avocado toast supply chain. By following these recommendations, we can help to reduce the environmental impact of this popular dish.
